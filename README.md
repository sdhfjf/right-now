This project is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) static website that operates using a single HTML file. The website allows seamless communication and peer discovery by sharing just one initial peer ID. Once a peer ID is known, it is automatically propagated and shared among other peers, ensuring smooth and efficient connectivity across the network.

## Key Features

- **Single HTML File**: The entire site is contained in one HTML file, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.
- **Peer Discovery**: After connecting to the network with a known peer ID, the system automatically shares this ID with other peers, creating a distributed network without requiring manual sharing.
- **P2P Communication**: The website supports direct communication between peers, eliminating the need for a central server and promoting a decentralized architecture.
- **Automatic Propagation**: Once connected, the initial peer ID is continuously propagated between all participants, ensuring automatic peer discovery and connectivity without further user input.
