**Project Description:**

This is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) static website that operates entirely through one HTML file. The key feature of this system is the ability to connect peers seamlessly by sharing only one initial peer ID. Once a peer ID is known and connected, it automatically propagates and shares this information with other peers in the network. This eliminates the need for manually sharing IDs between peers beyond the initial one.

Key Features:
Single HTML File: The entire website is contained within one HTML file, minimizing complexity.
Peer Discovery: Once a peer connects to the network via an initial peer ID, it automatically shares this ID with other connected peers, ensuring decentralized communication and discovery.
P2P Communication: Direct communication between users without needing a central server, fostering a distributed, resilient architecture.
Automatic Propagation: After one peer is identified, the network dynamically shares and updates peer IDs between all participants, ensuring continuous peer discovery and updates without user intervention.
Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any specific parts, or provide examples of how this could work!
